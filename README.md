## Data Scientist

### About Me
As a Master's student in Data Science at Middle Tennessee State University, I am passionate about leveraging data to solve real-world problems. My academic journey began with a Bachelor's in Computer Science (with a focus on IoT) from Parul University, where I graduated with distinction and co-authored a publication on an innovative Indoor Positioning System using Li-Fi technology. I am deeply interested in machine learning, data analytics, and artificial intelligence, continuously seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills.

I have gained practical experience as a Data Science Intern at SlashMark, where I developed and optimized machine learning models, achieving a 95% accuracy rate in predictive modeling. Additionally, I created dynamic data visualizations and worked on a wide range of projects, from demand forecasting using SARIMA models to building deep learning solutions for diabetic retinopathy screening. My hands-on experience also extends to web development, where I developed interactive prototypes and improved project efficiency during my internship at Academor Online.

Looking ahead, I am focused on advancing my career in data science, with a particular interest in Machine Learning and AI-driven solutions. I aspire to work on impactful projects that push the boundaries of machine learning and contribute to solving complex business challenges. I am open to new opportunities in data science and related fields, eager to collaborate and innovate in a rapidly evolving industry.
